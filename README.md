### Deploying the Bot/Contributing 
1. First fork the repository. 
2. In your terminal, run `git clone REPOLINK`
3. Create a .env file with `BOT_TOKEN` variable set to your bot token from your Discord Developer's Portal (see .env.example for formating).
4. In the cloned repository, use `npm i` to install all dependencies.
5. In the terminal type `npm run dev` to open developer's mode. The bot should be live now (make sure to add your bot to a server to test your changes before making a pull request).
6. Make your changes and make a pull request with a detailed and concise commit message.
